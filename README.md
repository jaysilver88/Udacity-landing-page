# Landing Page Project

This project is a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the purpose of demonstrating an understanding of manipulation of the DOM in various ways.

Interactive functionality is on display as elements are created to interact with event listeners, appended, styled, and reclassed for the purposes of dynamic navigation.
